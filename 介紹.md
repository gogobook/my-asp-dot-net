## INTRODUCTION
...前略

隨著時間的推移，C＃藉由泛型，語言集成查詢（LINQ），lambda表達式，動態特性和更容易的異步編程得到增強。 C＃不是一種簡單的編程語言，因為它提供了許多功能，但它不斷發展，具有實用的功能。
C＃不僅僅是面向對像或基於組件的語言; 它還包括函數式編程的思想 - 這些東西對於開發各種應用程序的通用語言都是實用的。
伴隨著C＃6，編譯器的源代碼被完全重寫。 它不僅僅是新的編譯器管道可以從自定義程序中使用; 微軟還獲得了新的資源，其中的變化不會破壞程序的其他部分。 因此，增強編譯器變得容易得多。
C＃7再次添加了許多來自函數式編程背景的新功能，例如本地函數，元組和模式匹配。

### C＃7中有什麼新功能
C＃6擴展包括`static using`靜態使用，表達式主體的方法和屬性，自動實現屬性初始值設定項，只讀自動屬性，`nameof`運算符，空條件運算符，字符串插值，字典初始值設定項，異常過濾器和等待捕獲。C＃7的變化是什麼？

### 數字分隔符
數字分隔符使代碼更具可讀性。在聲明變量時，可以將`_`添加到單獨的數字中。編譯器只刪除_。以下代碼片段在C＃7中看起來更具可讀性：

#### 在C＃6中
`long n1 = 0x1234567890ABCDEF;`

#### 在C＃7中
`long n2 = 0x1234_5678_90AB_CDEF;`

使用C＃7.2，您也可以將_放在開頭。

#### 在C＃7.2中
`long n2 = 0x_1234_5678_90AB_CDEF;`

數字分隔符將在第2章“核心C＃”中介紹。

### 二進製文字
C＃7為二進製文件提供了一個新的文字。二進製文件只能包含值0和1.現在數字分隔符變得尤為重要：

#### 在C＃7中
`uint binary1 = 0b1111_0000_1010_0101_1111_0000_1010_0101;`
二進製文字在第2章中介紹。

### 表達式主體的成員
C＃6允許表達式主體方法和屬性。使用C＃7，表達式主體可以與構造函數，析構函數，本地函數，屬性訪問器等一起使用。在這裡，您可以看到C＃6和C＃7之間的屬性訪問器的區別：
In C# 6

```csharp
private string _firstName;
public string FirstName
{
get { return _firstName; }
set { Set(ref _firstName, value); }
}
```
In C# 7
```csharp
private string _firstName;
public string FirstName
{
get => _firstName;
set => Set(ref _firstName, value);
}
```
Expression-bodied members are covered in Chapter 3, “Objects and Types.”

### Out Var
Before C# 7, `out` variables had to be declared before its use. With C# 7, the code is reduced by one line because the variable can be declared on use:

In C# 6
```csharp
string n = "42";
int result;
if (string.TryParse(n, out result)
{
Console.WriteLine($"Converting to a number was successful: {result}");
}
```

In C# 7
```csharp
string n = "42";
if (string.TryParse(n, out var result)
{
Console.WriteLine($"Converting to a number was successful: {result}");
}
```
This feature is covered in Chapter 3.

### Non-Trailing Named Arguments 非尾隨命名參數。
C# supports named arguments that are required with optional arguments but can support readability in any cases. With C# 7.2, non-trailing named arguments are supported. Argument names can be added to any argument with C# 7.2:

In C# 7.0
```csharp
if (Enum.TryParse(weekdayRecommendation.Entity, ignoreCase: true,
result: out DayOfWeek weekday))
{
reservation.Weekday = weekday;
}
```
In C# 7.2
```csharp
if (Enum.TryParse(weekdayRecommendation.Entity, ignoreCase: true,
out DayOfWeek weekday))
{
reservation.Weekday = weekday;
}
```
Named arguments are covered in Chapter 3.

### Readonly Struct
Structures should be read-only (with some exceptions). Using C# 7.2 it’s possible to declare the struct with the `readonly` modifier, so the compiler verifies that the struct is not changed. This guarantee can also be used by the compiler to not copy a struct that passes it as a parameter but instead passes it as a reference:
In C# 7.2
```csharp
public readonly struct Dimensions
{
    public double Length { get; }
    public double Width { get; }
    public Dimensions(double length, double width)
    {
        Length = length;
        Width = width;
    }
    public double Diagonal => Math.Sqrt(Length * Length + Width * Width);
}
```
The readonly struct is covered in Chapter 3.

### In Parameters
C# 7.2 also allows the `in` modifier with parameters. This guarantees that a passed value type is not changed, and it can be passed by reference to avoid a copy:
In C# 7.2
```csharp
static void CantChange(in AStruct s)
{
// s can't change
}
```
`ref` , `in` , and `out` modifiers are covered in Chapter 3.

### Private Protected
C# 7.2 adds a new access modifier: `private protected` . The access modifier protected internal allows access to the member if it’s used from a type in the same assembly, or from a type from another assembly that derives from the class. With private protected, it’s an AND instead of an OR--access is only allowed if the class derives from the base class and is in the same assembly.
Access modifiers are covered in Chapter 4, “Object-Oriented Programming with C#.”

## Target-Typed Default
With C# 7.1, a `default` literal is defined that allows a shorter syntax compared to the `default` operator.
The `default` operator always requires the repetition of the type, which is now not needed anymore. This is practical with complex types:
In C# 7.0
```csharp
int x = default(int);
ImmutableArray<int> arr = default(ImmutableArray<int>);
```
In C# 7.1
```csharp
int x = default;
ImmutableArray<int> arr = default;
```
The `default` literal is covered in Chapter 5, “Generics.”

### Local Functions
Before C# 7, it was not possible to declare a function within a method. You could create a lambda expression and invoke it as shown here in the C# 6 code snippet:
In C# 6
```csharp
public void SomeFunStuff()
{
    Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
    int result = add(38, 4);
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```
With C# 7, a local function can be declared within a method. The local function is only accessible within the scope of the method:
In C# 7
```csharp  
public void SomeFunStuff()
{
    int add(int x, int y) => x + y;
    int result = add(38, 4);
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```
Local functions are explained in Chapter 13, “Functional Programming.” You see it in different uses in several chapters of the book.

### Tuples
Tuples allow combining objects of different types. Before C# 7, tuples have been part of the .NET Framework with the Tuple class. The members of the tuple can be accessed with `Item1 , Item2 , Item3` , and so on. In C# 7, tuples are part of the language, and you can define the names of the members:
In C# 6
```csharp
var t1 = Tuple.Create(42, "astring");
int i1 = t1.Item1;
string s1 = t1.Item2;
```
In C# 7
```csharp
var t1 = (n: 42, s: "magic");
int i1 = t1.n;
string s1 = t1.s;
```
Other than that, the new tuples are value types `(ValueTuple)` whereas the Tuple type is a reference type.
All the changes with tuples are covered in Chapter 13.

### Inferred Tuple Names
C# 7.1 extends tuples by automatically inferring tuple names, similar to anonymous types. With C# 7.0, the members of the tuple always need to be named. In case the tuple member should have the same name as the property or field you assign to it, with C# 7.1, if the name is not supplied, it has the same name as the assigned member:
In C# 7.0
```csharp
var t1 = (FirstName: racer.FirstName, Wins: racer.Wins);
int wins = t1.Wins;
```
In C# 7.1
```csharp
var t1 = (racer.FirstName, racer.Wins);
int wins = t1.Wins;
```

### Deconstructors
No, this is not a typo. Deconstructors are not destructors. A tuple can be deconstructed to separate variables, such as the following:
In C# 7
```csharp
(int n, string s) = (42, "magic");
```
It’s also possible to deconstruct a Person object, if a Deconstruct method is defined:
In C# 7
```csharp
var p1 = new Person("Tom", "Turbo");
(string firstName, string lastName) = p1;
```
Deconstruction is covered in Chapter 13.

### Pattern Matching
With pattern matching, the `is` operator and the switch `statement` have been enhanced with three kinds of patterns: the const pattern, the type pattern, and the var pattern. The following code snippet shows patterns with the `is` operator. The first check for a match matches the constant `42`, the second match checks for a `Person` object, and the third match checks every object with the var pattern. Using the type and the var pattern, a variable can be declared for strongly typed access:
In C# 7
```csharp
public void PatternMatchingWithIsOperator(object o)
{
    if (o is 42)
    {
    }
    if (o is Person p)
    {
    }
    if (o is var v1)
    {
    }
}
```
Using the `switch` statement, you can use the same patterns with the case clause. You can also declare a variable to be strongly typed in case the pattern matches. You can also use when to filter the pattern on a condition:
In C# 7
```csharp
public void PatternMatchingWithSwitchStatement(object o)
{
    swtich (o)
    {
        case 42:
            break;
        case Person p when p.FirstName == "Katharina":
            break;
        case Person p:
            break;
        case var v:
            break;
    }
}
```
Pattern matching is covered in Chapter 13.

### Throw Expressions
Throwing exceptions was only possible with a statement; it wasn’t possible in an expression. Thus, when receiving a parameter with a constructor, extra checks for null were necessary to throw an ArgumentNullException . With C# 7, exceptions can be thrown in expressions, thus it is possible to throw the ArgumentNullException when the left side is null--using the coalescing operator.
In C# 6
```csharp
private readonly IBooksService _booksService;
public BookController(BooksService booksService)
    {
        if (booksService == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(b));
        }
        _booksService = booksService;
    }
```
In C# 7
```csharp
private readonly IBooksService _booksService;
public BookController(BooksService booksService)
{
    _booksService = booksService ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(b));
}
```
Throwing expressions is covered in Chapter 14, “Errors and Exceptions.”

### Async Main
Before C# 7.1, the Main method always needed to be declared of type void . With C# 7.1, the Main method can also be of type `Task` and use the `async` and `await` keywords:
In C# 7.0
```csharp
static void Main()
{
    SomeMethodAsync().Wait();
}
```
In C# 7.1
```csharp
async static Task Main()
{
    await SomeMethodAsync();
}
```
Asynchronous programming is covered in Chapter 15, “Asynchronous Programming.”

### Reference Semantics
.NET Core has a big focus on enhancing the performance. Additions to C# features for reference semantics help increase the performance. Before C# 7, the `ref` keyword could be used with parameters to pass value types by reference. Now it’s also possible to use the `ref` keyword with the return type and with local variables.
The following code snippet declares the method GetNumber to return a reference to an `int` . This way, the caller has direct access to the element in the array and can change its content:
In C# 7.0
```csharp
int[] _numbers = { 3, 7, 11, 15, 21 };
public ref int GetNumber(int index)
{
    return ref _numbers[index];
}
```
With C# 7.2, the `readonly` modifier can be added to `ref` returns. This way the caller can’t change the content of the returned value, but still reference semantics is used, and a copy of the value type when returning the result can be avoided. The caller receives a reference but isn’t allowed to change it:
In C# 7.2
```csharp
int[] _numbers = { 3, 7, 11, 15, 21 };
public ref readonly int GetNumber(int index)
{
    return ref _numbers[index];
}
```
Before C# 7.2, C# could create reference types (a class) and value types (a struct). However, the struct could also be stored on the heap when boxing took place. With C# 7.2, a type can be declared that is only allowed on the stack: `ref struct :`
In C# 7.2
```csharp
ref struct OnlyOnTheStack
{
}
```
The new features for references are covered in Chapter 17, “Managed and Unmanaged Memory.”

### WHAT’S NEW IN ASP.NET CORE
With .NET Core and Visual Studio 2017, we have a new project file. The .NET Core tools that were in
preview with Visual Studio 2015 are released with Visual Studio 2017. The tools switched to the MSBuild
environment with `csproj` files, so now we have `csproj` files both with .NET Framework as well as .NET
Core applications. However, it’s not the `csproj` you know from previous generations. `csproj` files are a lot
shorter and simplified, and you can also modify them by using a simple text editor.
.NET Core 2.0 is enhanced with classes and methods defined in the .NET Standard 2.0, which makes it
easier to bring existing .NET Framework applications to .NET Core.
Creating an ASP.NET Core project, not only the `csproj` file gets simplified, but also the C# source code.
When you use the default WebHostBuilder , a lot more is predefined. Configuration and logging providers
are added without you needing to add them yourself. With ASP.NET Core MVC, small improvements have
been made—for example, view components can now be used from a tag helper.
There’s also a new technology—Razor Pages—which is easier to learn than ASP.NET Core MVC. Some
apps don’t need the abstraction from the Model-View-Controller pattern; this is where Razor Pages has its
place.

### WHAT’S NEW WITH THE UNIVERSAL WINDOWS PLATFORM
Two times a year we get updates with Windows 10. (If you are in the Windows Insiders program, you
get the updates more often, but that’s not the norm for most users.) Every update of Windows releases a
new SDK. The latest two updates have been the Creators Update (build 15063, March 2017) and the Fall
Creators Update (build 16299, October 2017).
Microsoft continues to offer new design features that are integrated in the Windows controls. The
new design is named Fluent Design, which is incorporated in standard controls and is also directly accessible—for example, with the acrylic and reveal brushes. The ParallaxView has been added for a parallax effect in your apps.
Features are also added to enhance productivity. You can use the Windows Template Studio—an extension
in Visual Studio—to have a template editor to create many pages and use services pre-generated.
XAML has been enhanced with conditional XAML to make it easier to support multiple Windows 10 versions but use new features not available in older Windows 10 editions.
The InkCanvas control offers new rulers that can be easily incorporated in your apps. The NavigationView
makes it easy to create adaptive menus with a hamburger button and a SplitView . You can read about all
these new features and many more in the fourth part of the book.

### WHAT YOU NEED TO WRITE AND RUN C# CODE
.NET Core runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems. You can create and build your programs
on any of these operating systems using Visual Studio Code ( https://code.visualstudio.com ).
The best developer tool to use, and the tool used with this book, is Visual Studio 2017. You can use Visual
Studio Community 2017 edition ( https://www.visualstudio.com ), but some features shown are avail-
able only with the Enterprise edition of Visual Studio. It will be mentioned where the Enterprise edition is
needed. Visual Studio 2017 requires the Windows 10 build 1507 or higher, Windows 8.1, Windows Server
2012 R2, or Windows 7 SP1. To build and run the Windows apps (Universal Windows Platform) shown in
this book, you need Windows 10.
For creating and building Xamarin apps for iOS, you also need a Mac for the build system. Without the
Mac, you can still create Xamarin apps for Windows and Android.
For developing apps on the Mac, you can use Visual Studio for Mac: https://www.visualstudio.com/
vs/visual-studio-mac/ . You can use this tool to create ASP.NET Core and Xamarin apps, but you can’t
create and test Windows apps.

### WHAT THIS BOOK COVERS
This book starts by reviewing the overall architecture of .NET in Chapter 1 to give you the background you
need to write managed code. You’ll get an overview about the different application types and learn how to
compile with the new development environment CLI, as well as see the most important parts for a start in
Visual Studio. After that, the book is divided into sections that cover both the C# language and its application in a variety of areas.

###Part I: The C# Language
This section gives a good grounding in the C# language. This section doesn’t presume knowledge of any
particular language, although it does assume you are an experienced programmer. You start by looking
at C#’s basic syntax and data types and then explore the object-oriented programming before you look at
more advanced C# programming topics like delegates, lambda expressions, and Language Integrated Query
(LINQ).
As C# contains many features that come from functional programming, you learn the foundation of
functional programming among tuples and pattern matching. Asynchronous programming and the new language features for the reference semantics are covered. This section concludes with a tour through many
Visual Studio 2017 features. You also learn foundations of Docker as well as how Visual Studio 2017 supports Docker out of the box.

### Part II: .NET Core and the Windows Runtime
Chapters 19 to 29 cover topics from .NET Core and the Windows Runtime that are independent of application types. This section starts with creating libraries and NuGet packages in Chapter 19, “Libraries, Assemblies, Packages, and NuGet.” You learn how to use the .NET Standard in the best way.
Dependency injection (DI) is used with .NET Core no matter where you look: services are injected with Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core MVC uses hundreds of services. DI makes it easy to use the same code across WPF, UWP, and Xamarin. Chapter 20, “Dependency Injection,” is dedicated to the foundations of DI, and you also learn advanced features from the Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection DI container, including adapting non-Microsoft containers. Many of the other
chapters use DI as well.
Chapter 21, “Tasks and Parallel Programming,” covers parallel programming using the Task Parallel Library (TPL) as well as various objects for synchronization.
In Chapter 22, “Files and Streams,” you read about accessing the file system and reading files and directories. You learn about using both streams from the System.IO namespace and streams from the Windows Runtime for programming Windows apps.
Chapter 23, “Networking,” covers the core foundation of networking using sockets, as well as using higher level abstractions like the HttpClient .
Chapter 24, “Security,” makes use of streams when you learn about security and how to encrypt data and allow for secure conversion. This chapter also covers some topics you need to know when creating web applications, such as issues with SQL injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
Chapters 25 and 26 show you how to access the database. Chapter 25 uses ADO.NET directly, explains transactions, and covers using ambient transactions with .NET Core. Chapter 26 goes through all the new features offered by Entity Framework Core 2.0. EF Core 2.0 has many features that were not available with
the older Entity Framework 6.x technology.
In Chapter 27, “Localization,” you learn to localize applications using techniques that are important both for Windows and web applications. When you’re creating functionality with C# code, don’t skip the step of creating unit tests. It takes more time in the beginning, but over time you’ll see advantages when you add functionality and maintain code.
Chapter 28, “Testing,” covers creating unit tests, including Live Unit Testing with Visual Studio 2017, web tests, and coded UI tests.
Finally, Chapter 29, “Tracing, Logging, and Analytics,” covers the logging facility from .NET Core as well as using Visual Studio AppCenter for analytic information.

### Part III: Web Applications and Services
In this section you look at web applications and services. You should start this section with Chapter 30, “ASP.NET Core,” to give you the foundation of ASP.NET Core. Creating web applications with the MVC pattern, including the new technology Razor Pages, is covered in Chapter 31, “ASP.NET Core MVC.” Chapter 32 covers the REST service features of ASP.NET Core: Web API.

### Part IV: Apps
This section is about building apps with XAML—both Universal Windows apps and Xamarin. You learn about the foundation of Windows Apps including the foundation of XAML in Chapter 33, “Windows Apps,” with the XAML syntax, dependency properties, and markup extensions where you can create your own XAML syntax. The chapter covers the different categories of Windows controls and the foundation of data binding with XAML.
A big focus on the MVVM (model-view-view model) pattern is in Chapter 34, “Patterns with XAML Apps.” Here you learn to take advantage of the data-binding features of XAML-based applications, which allow sharing a lot of code between Windows apps, WPF, and Xamarin. You also can share a lot of code developing for the iOS and Android platforms. Creating WPF applications is not covered in the book itself—this technology didn’t get many improvements in the recent years, and you should think about a switch to the Universal Windows Platform, which can be done easier if you use the knowledge you learn in Chapter 34. WPF applications still need to be maintained. For a deeper coverage of WPF, you should read the previous edition of this book, Professional C# 6 and .NET Core 1.0.
In Chapter 35, “Styling Windows Apps,” you learn about styling your XAML-based apps. Chapter 36, “Advanced Windows Apps,” goes into advanced features of creating Windows apps with the Universal Windows Platform. You learn about App Services, inking, the AutoSuggest control, advanced compiled binding features, and more.
Chapter 37, “Xamarin.Forms,” helps you start Xamarin development for Windows, Android, and iPhone, and shows what happens behind the scenes. You learn the differences between Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, and what’s covered with Xamarin.Forms. You’ll see the how the Xamarin.Forms controls differ from the Windows controls for making a faster move from Windows development to Xamarin. A larger sample from this chapter uses the same MVVM libraries done for the Windows apps from Chapter 34.
