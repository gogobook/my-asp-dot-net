THE HELL OF LIBRARIES
Libraries make it possible for you to reuse code in multiple
applications. With Windows, libraries have a long history, and
architecture guidelines have taken different directions with newer
technologies. Before .NET, dynamic link libraries (DLLs) could be
shared between different applications. These DLLs have been installed
in a shared directory. It wasn’t possible to have multiple versions of
these libraries on the same system, but they should have been upward
compatible. Of course, this wasn’t always the case. In addition, there
were problems with application installations that did not pay attention
to the guidelines and replaced a shared library with an older one. This
was the DLL Hell.
.NET tried to solve this with assemblies. Assemblies are libraries that
could be shared. In addition to normal DLLs, assemblies contain
extensible metadata with information about the library and a version
number, and it’s possible to install multiple versions side by side in the
global assembly cache. Microsoft tried to fix versioning issues, but
this added another layer of complexity.
Let’s assume you’re using library A and B from your application X (see
Figure 19-1). Application X references version 1.1 from library A and
version 1.0 from library B. The issue is that library B references library
A as well, but it references a different version—version 1.0. One
process can only have one version of a library loaded. What version of
the library A is loaded into the process? In case library B is used before
library A, version 1.0 wins. This is a big issue as soon as application X
needs to use library A itself.


FIGURE 19-1
To avoid this issue, you could configure assembly redirects. You can
define an assembly redirect for application X to load version 1.1 from
library A. Library B then needs to use version 1.1 from library A as
well. In case library A is upward-compatible, this shouldn’t be an
issue.
Of course, compatibility doesn’t always exist, and issues can be more
complex. Publishers of components can create a publisher policy to
define redirects with the library itself. This redirect can be overridden
by the application. There’s a lot of complexity with this, which resulted
in Assembly Hell.
NOTE
With .NET Core there’s no global sharing of assemblies as it was
with the .NET Framework. Only the .NET runtime can be shared
between different applications.
NuGet packages add another abstraction layer to libraries. A NuGet
package can contain multiple versions of one or more assemblies,
along with other stuff, such as automatic configuration of assembly


redirects.
Instead of waiting for new .NET Framework releases, you could add
functionality via NuGet packages, which allowed for faster updates of
the packages. NuGet packages are a great delivery vehicle. Some
libraries like Entity Framework switched to NuGet to allow for faster
updates than the .NET Framework offered.
However, there are some issues with NuGet. Often adding NuGet
packages to projects fail. NuGet packages might not be compatible
with the project. When adding packages was successful, it can happen
that the package made some incorrect configuration with the project,
e.g. wrong binding redirects. This results in the feeling of the NuGet
Package Hell. The problems from DLLs moved to different abstraction
layers and are indeed different. With newer NuGet versions and
advancements in NuGet, Microsoft has tried to solve the issues with
NuGet.
Directions in the architecture of .NET Core also changed. With .NET
Core, packages have been made more granular. For example, with the
.NET Framework, the Console class is inside the mscorlib assembly,
which is an assembly needed by every .NET Framework application.
Of course, not every .NET application needs the Console class. With
.NET Core 1.0, a separate package System.Console exists that contains
the Console class and a few related classes. The goal was to make it
easier to update and select what packages are really needed. With
some Beta versions of .NET Core 1.0, the project files contained a large
list of packages, which didn’t make development easier. Just before
the release of .NET Core 1.0, Microsoft introduced meta-packages (or
reference-packages). A meta-package doesn’t include code but instead
a list of other packages.
With .NET Core 2.0 includes another simplification. When you created
a “Hello, World!” Console application with .NET Core 1.1, the
generated project.asset.json file has a size of 313 KB. This file (in the
obj directory) shows the tree of dependencies. With .NET Core 2.0, the
file size was reduced to 33 KB because of larger packages with fewer
references.
This chapter goes into the detail of assemblies and NuGet packages,


explains how to share code using .NET Standard libraries, and also
explains differences with Windows Runtime components.
ASSEMBLIES
An assembly is a library or executable that includes additional
metadata. Using .NET Core, the application containing the Main
method is created as a library with the file extension .dll . This DLL
needs a hosting process to load this library, which you do using dotnet
run , or just dotnet from a runtime environment. When you create
standalone applications with .NET Core, different executables are
created for every platform to load the library.
Let’s have a look at a simple “Hello, World!” console application
created in the directory ConsoleApp , using the command
> dotnet new console
After building the application, the DLL can be found in the
bin/debug/netcoreapp2.0 directory. The netcoreapp2.0 directory
depends on the target framework listed in the csproj project file.
Assembly information can be read using the ildasm.exe (IL
Disassembler) command-line utility. Ildasm.exe shows the types of the
assembly with its members, with the additional metadata as shown in
Figure 19-2.


FIGURE 19-2
Clicking MANIFEST (refer to Figure 19-2), opens metadata
information for the assembly as shown in Figure 19-3. The assembly
which has the name ConsoleApp , references the assemblies
System.Runtime and System.Console . You also can see several
configured assembly attributes such as AssemblyCompanyNameAttribute ,
AssemblyConfigurationAttribute , AssemblyDescriptionAttribute ,
AssemblyFileVersionAttribute , and others.
FIGURE 19-3
Assembly metadata that describes the application can be configured
using Visual Studio; select Package in the Project Properties (see
Figure 19-4).


FIGURE 19-4
Of course, you can also directly edit the project file (code file
ConsoleApp/ConsoleApp.csproj ):
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>

</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
NOTE
With previous projects, such metadata information was typically
added to the file AssemblyInfo.cs by adding this information with
global C# attributes. You can still do it this way, but then you
need to configure the csproj file to not automatically generate the
attributes.
CREATING LIBRARIES
You can use shared code by creating libraries. With Visual Studio
2017, you’ve many options to create libraries, as shown here:
Class Library (.NET Core)
Class Library (.NET Standard)
Class Library (.NET Framework)
WPF Custom Control Library (.NET Framework)
WPF User Control Library (.NET Framework)
Windows Forms Control Library (.NET Framework)
Class Library (Universal Windows)
Class Library (Legacy Portable)
Shared Project
The Shared Project listed is not really a class library, but you can use it
for sharing code from multiple projects. See the section “Using Shared
Projects” later in this chapter for more information.
The class libraries identified with .NET Framework in the preceding
list are meant to be used with .NET Framework applications, and they


can have specific restrictions. The WPF User Control Library and WPF
Custom Control Library can be used only from WPF applications.
Similarly, the Windows Forms Control Library can be used only from
Windows Forms applications.
Class Library (Legacy Portable) already has legacy in its name. This
project template, which was originally known as Portable Class Library
(PCL) shouldn’t be used with new applications. This library enables
you to share code between different technologies, such as sharing code
between Silverlight, WPF, Xamarin, .NET Core, and so on. Depending
on the platform and version selection, different APIs are available. The
more platforms and the older the version chosen, the fewer APIs are
available. As more and more platforms have been added, this
increased the complexity of the definitions and also increased
complexity on using portable libraries from portable libraries.
.NET Standard provides a replacement for portable libraries.
.NET Standard
The .NET Standard makes a linear definition of APIs available, which
is different than the matrix definition with APIs that was available for
portable libraries. Every version of the .NET Standard adds APIs, and
APIs are never removed.
The higher the version of the .NET Standard, the more APIs you can
use. However, the .NET Standard doesn’t implement the APIs; it just
defines the APIs that need to be implemented by a .NET platform. This
can be compared to interfaces and concrete classes. An interface just
defines a contract for members that need to be implemented by a
class. With the .NET Standard, the .NET Standard specifies what APIs
need to be available, and a .NET platform—supporting a specific
version of the standard—needs to implement these APIs.
You can find which APIs are available with which standard version, as
well as the differences between the standards, at
https://github.com/dotnet/standard/tree/master/docs/versions .
Every version of the .NET Standard adds APIs to the standard:
.NET Standard 1.1 added 2,414 APIs to .NET Standard 1.0.


Version 1.2 added just 46 APIs.
With 1.3, 3,314 APIs were added.
Version 1.4 added only 18 Cryptography APIs .
Version 1.5 mainly enhanced reflection support and added 242
APIs.
Version 1.6 added more Cryptography APIs and enhanced regular
expressions, with a total of 146 additional APIs.
With .NET Standard 2.0, Microsoft made a big investment to make it
easier to move legacy applications to .NET Core. With this new
standard, 19,507 APIs have been added. Not all of these APIs were
new. Some were already implemented with .NET Framework 4.6.1.
For example, old APIs like DataSet , DataTable , and others are now
available with the .NET Standard. This was a move to make it easier to
bring legacy applications to the .NET Standard. A huge investment
was needed for .NET Core, because .NET Core 2.0 implements the
.NET Standard 2.0.
What APIs are not in the standard and never will be? Platform-specific
APIs are not expected to be part of the .NET Standard. For example,
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms
define Windows-specific APIs that will not make it into the standard.
You can, however, create WPF and Windows Forms applications and
use .NET Standard libraries from there. You cannot create .NET
Standard libraries that contain WPF or Windows Forms controls.
New APIs that are tested are coming first to .NET Core. As soon as the
APIs stabilize, there’s a good chance they will be available with a
future version of the .NET Standard.
Let’s get into more details on the platform support of .NET Standard.
If you need to support Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1, you need to
restrict your library to the APIs that are available with .NET Standard
1.0. Of course, nowadays there’s typically no need to support any
Silverlight version. Let’s get into more important .NET platforms.
For using libraries from the Universal Windows Platform, you need to
pay attention to what build number you want to support. If you’re


supporting only the Fall Creators Update of Windows 10, you can
already use .NET Standard 2.0. For supporting the Creators Update
and older Windows 10 builds, you just can go up to .NET Standard 1.4.
Newer versions are not possible in such cases. If you create a library
containing ASP.NET Core 1.1 controllers, the library needs to be
version 1.6 of the standard.
NOTE
To support the most platforms possible, you need to select a lower
.NET Standard version. To have more APIs available, select a
higher .NET Standard version.
Creating a .NET Standard Library
To create a .NET Standard library, you can use the .NET Core CLI
tools with the command
dotnet new classlib
Using the .NET Core 2.0 CLI tools, this creates a library with this
csproj definition (code file UsingLibs/SimpleLib/SimpleLib.csproj ):
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
You can change the version of the .NET Standard library by changing
the TargetFramework element. From Visual Studio, you can use the
Application Settings of the Project Properties to change the .NET
Standard version (see Figure 19-5).


FIGURE 19-5
Solution Files
When you work with multiple projects (for example, a console
application and a library), it’s helpful to work with solution files. With
the newer versions of the .NET Core CLI tools, you can use solutions
from the command line as well as using them from Visual Studio. For
example,
> dotnet new sln
creates a solution file in the current directory.
Using the dotnet sln add command, you can add projects to the
solution file:
dotnet sln add SimpleLib/SimpleLib.csproj
The project files are added to the solution file as shown in the
following snippet (solution file UsingLibs\UsingLibs.sln ):
Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00
# Visual Studio 15
VisualStudioVersion = 15.0.26124.0


MinimumVisualStudioVersion = 15.0.26124.0
Project("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}") =
"SimpleLib",
"SimpleLib\SimpleLib.csproj", "{C58F9225-7407-45A0-932A-
81AC3906F228}"
EndProject
Project("{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}") =
"ConsoleApp",
"ConsoleApp\ConsoleApp.csproj", "{31E6F88A-C0BC-4277-A9E9-
19DAFDEB1A7A}"
EndProject
Global
# ...
When you’re using Visual Studio, you can select the solution in the
Solution Explorer to add new projects. From the context menu, select
Add and then select Existing Project to add existing projects.
Referencing Projects
You can reference a library by using the dotnet add reference
command. The current directory just needs to be positioned in the
directory of the project where the library should be added:
dotnet add reference ..\SimpleLib\SimpleLib.csproj
The reference is added using a ProjectReference element in the csproj
file (project file UsingLibs/ConsoleApp/ConsoleApp.csproj ):
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<ItemGroup>
<ProjectReference Include="..\SimpleLib\SimpleLib.csproj"
/>
</ItemGroup>
<PropertyGroup>
<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
Using the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, you can add projects to
other projects by selecting the Dependencies node and then selecting


the Add Reference command from the Project menu. This dialog box
shown in Figure 19-6 opens.
FIGURE 19-6
Referencing NuGet Packages
If the library is already packaged within a NuGet package, the NuGet
package can be directly referenced with the command dotnet add
package :
dotnet add package Microsoft.Composition
Instead of adding a ProjectReference as before, this adds a
PackageReference :
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<ItemGroup>
<ProjectReference Include="..\SimpleLib\SimpleLib.csproj"
/>
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Composition"
Version="1.0.31" />
</ItemGroup>
<PropertyGroup>
<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>


</Project>
To request a specific version of the package, you can specify the --
version option with the .NET Core CLI command. With Visual Studio,
you can use the NuGet Package Manager (see Figure 19-7) to find
packages and select a specific version of the package. With this tool,
you also can get details on the package with links to the project and
licensing information.
FIGURE 19-7
NOTE
Not all the packages you find on www.nuget.org are useful with
your application. You should check licensing information to make
sure the license fits with your project needs. Also, you should
check the package author. If it’s an open-source package, how
active is the community behind it?


NuGet Sources
Where are the packages coming from? www.nuget.org is a server where
Microsoft and third parties upload .NET packages. After the packages
have been downloaded from the NuGet server for the first time, the
packages are stored in the user profile. Thus, it becomes a lot faster to
create another project with the same packages.
On Windows, the directory for the packages in the user profile is
%userprofile%\.nuget\packages . Other temporary directories are used
as well. To get all the information about these directories, it’s best to
install the NuGet command-line utility, which you can download from
https://dist.nuget.org/ .
To see the folders for the global packages, the HTTP cache, and the
temp packages, you can use nuget locals :
> nuget locals all -list
In some companies, it’s permissible to use only packages that have
been approved and are stored in a local NuGet server. The default
configuration for the NuGet server is in the file NuGet.Config in the
directory %appdata%/nuget .
A default configuration looks similar to the following NuGet.Config file.
Packages are loaded from https://api.nuget.org and the local
NuGetFallbackFolder :
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
<packageSources>
<add key="nuget.org"
value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json"
protocolVersion="3" />
<add key="CliFallbackFolder"
value="C:\Users\chris\.dotnet\NuGetFallbackFolder"
/>
</packageSources>
</configuration>
You can change the defaults by adding and removing package sources.


Microsoft doesn’t store packages from the daily build on the main
NuGet server. To use daily builds of .NET Core NuGet packages, you
need to configure other NuGet servers. You can also configure local
directories where you put your custom NuGet packages. The following
NuGet.Config file adds a local directory and the nightly feed of .NET
Core packages to the package sources.
<configuration>
<packageSources>
<add key="local packages" value="C:\git\mypackages" />
<add key="dotnet-core"
value="https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-
core/api/v3/index.json" />
</packageSources>
</configuration>
Instead of changing the default configuration file, you can place a
configuration file into the project directory. This way, the configured
package sources are valid only for the project.
Using .NET Framework Libraries
As already mentioned earlier in the chapter, a big advantage of the
.NET Standard 2.0 is the additional APIs coming from the .NET
Framework. This makes it easier to move legacy .NET applications to
the new .NET.
.NET Standard libraries can be used from many different .NET
technologies. Of course, you can reference .NET Standard libraries
from .NET Core, but also from Mono and .NET Framework projects. A
WPF application can make use of a .NET Standard library. Such a
scenario was already possible with libraries created with .NET Core
1.0. But now, with .NET Standard 2.0, the interop scenario is
extended. You can also reference an old .NET Framework library from
a .NET Standard library as long as the .NET Framework library uses
only APIs available with the .NET Standard.
How is this possible? Trying such interop scenarios with earlier .NET
Core versions often resulted in compilation errors—for example, the
object type is defined two times. The reason for such issues can be
easily explained. With older .NET technologies, such as the .NET


Framework, core types such as the object class are defined in
mscorlib . With newer technologies such as .NET Core, the object type
is defined in System.Runtime . Using both, you often ended up with
duplicates of objects and other core types.
.NET Standard 2.0 changed the behavior. The .NET Standard defines
an API set, but not an implementation. The complete implementation
of the API needs to be done from the .NET platform, such as .NET
Framework and .NET Core. The standard is implemented using type
forwarding, which is forwarding types of the standard to a concrete
implementation. The new library that lists the types from the .NET
Standard is NetStandard.dll . This library is different for every
platform. NetStandard.dll lists the types but doesn’t contain any
implementation. Instead, this library contains type forwarders to the
specific implementation. For example, when you add a .NET Standard
library to a .NET framework project, the NetStandard.dll is referenced
automatically and contains a type forwarder for the System.Console
class to the mscorlib assembly:
.class extern forwarder System.Console
{
.assembly extern mscorlib
}
Accordingly, with a .NET Core project, the NetStandard.dll contains a
redirect of System.Console to the library System.Console :
.class extern forwarder System.Console
{
.assembly extern System.Console
}
Let’s see this in action by creating a legacy .NET Framework library
with the class Legacy . The methods ConsoleMessage and WindowsMessage
just write output. ConsoleMessage writes output to the console.
WindowsMessage , makes use of the .NET Framework library
System.Windows.Forms , and opens a MessageBox . Additionally, the
method ShowConsoleType gives information where the Console class is
coming from (code file
UsingLegacyLibs/DotnetFrameworkLib/Legacy.cs ):


public class Legacy
{
public static void ConsoleMessage(string message)
{
Console.WriteLine($"From the .NET Framework Lib:
{message}");
}
public static void ShowConsoleType()
{
Console.WriteLine($"The type {nameof(Console)} is from "
+
$"{Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(Console)).FullName}");
}
public static void WindowsMessage(string message)
{
MessageBox.Show($"Windows Forms: {message}");
}
}
What you need to be pay attention to in this scenario is that the
Console class is part of .NET Standard, but the MessageBox class is not.
Windows Forms is specific to Windows and will not be a part of the
.NET Standard.
Next, a .NET Standard Library references this .NET Framework
library. You can handle this in a simple way by adding a reference to
the project. The project file contains a ProjectReference to the .NET
Framework library (project file
UsingLegacyLibs/DotnetStandardLib/DotnetStandardLib.csproj ):
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<ProjectReference
Include="..\DotnetFrameworkLib\DotnetFrameworkLib.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
The Wrapper class defined in the .NET Standard library just forwards
the method calls to the .NET Framework library. There’s no
compilation error on building the .NET Standard library when


referencing the .NET Framework library (code file
UsingLegacyLibs/DotnetStandardLib/Wrapper.cs ):
public class Wrapper
{
public static void ConsoleMessage(string message) =>
Legacy.ConsoleMessage(message);
public static void WindowsMessage(string message) =>
Legacy.WindowsMessage(message);
public static void ShowConsoleType() =>
Legacy.ShowConsoleType();
}
Next, a .NET Core console application makes use of the Wrapper class.
The Program class invokes the three methods. However, check the
handling of the FileNotFoundException exception when calling the
WindowsMessage method (code file
UsingLegacyLibs/UsingLegacyLibs/Program.cs ):
static void Main()
{
Wrapper.ConsoleMessage("Hello from .NET Core");
Wrapper.ShowConsoleType();
try
{
Wrapper.WindowsMessage("Hello from .NET Core");
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
}
The application runs as shown in the following output. The Console
class is from the System.Console assembly. Invoking WindowsMessage
results in a FileNotFoundException because the System.Windows.Forms
assembly cannot be found:
From the .NET Framework Lib: Hello from .NET Core
The type Console is from System.Console, Version=4.1.0.0,
Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a
Could not load file or assembly 'System.Windows.Forms,


Version=4.0.0.0,
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.
The system cannot find the file specified.
When you create a .NET Framework Console application, there’s no
need to wrap the invocation of the WindowsMessage call into a try/catch
handler because System.Windows.Forms is available (code file
UsingLegacyLibs/DotnetFrameworkApp/Program.cs ):
static void Main()
{
Wrapper.ConsoleMessage("Hello from the .NET Framework");
Wrapper.ShowConsoleType();
Wrapper.WindowsMessage("Hello from the .NET Framework");
}
Running this application shows that the Console class is coming from
the mscorlib assembly, and a window pops up for the MessageBox :
From the .NET Framework Lib: Hello from the .NET Framework
The type Console is from mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0,
Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089
WARNING
It’s easy to reference .NET Framework assemblies from .NET
Core applications and build the application. However, this does
not mean that every functionality of the .NET Framework
assembly is available—only the types that are defined in the .NET
Standard. Using just these types enables you to use .NET
Framework libraries on Linux.
Usually it’s better to go for compilation errors if types are not
available. Rebuilding .NET Framework libraries as .NET
Standard libraries gives you this feature. Just in case you don’t
have the source code available, such as from vendors that don’t
offer .NET Standard libraries yet, you can still use the library
from .NET Core. To check binaries and find out what types are
not compatible with which version of the .NET Standard, you can


use the .NET Portability Analyzer that is available as a command-
line tool and a Visual Studio extension (see
https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet-apiport ).
Running the .NET Portability analyzer on the sample .NET
Framework library shows you information on what platform versions
support particular types and members (see table).

USING SHARED PROJECTS
Shared projects are not really libraries, but they are still helpful in
sharing code. Shared projects give an alternative to a library to share
the code but include the code with the project that references the
shared project. This way, platform-specific code can be added to the
shared project. However, this feature is useful only if not too much
code is different. When there are a lot of code differences, it might be a
better idea to create platform-specific libraries.
With the following code example, a .NET Core application and a
Universal Windows App are created, and both reference a shared
project. The shared project contains code that can be used with both
platforms, but each also contains code that is platform specific.
The difference starts with namespaces that are not available
everywhere. You can use preprocessor directives to check for
conditional compilation symbols. The preprocessor directive


Windows_UWP is defined with Universal Windows apps
UsingASharedProject/SharedProject/Message.cs ):
(code file
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
#if WINDOWS_UWP
using Windows.UI.Popups;
#endif
The Message class defines Show , ShowAsync , and Add methods. The Add
method is available for every platform. The Show method is available
only when the NETCOREAPP2_0 directive is defined, and the ShowAsync
method is available only for UWP apps. The class can be defined with
the internal access modifier because it’s not used outside of the
assembly boundaries:
internal class Message
{
#if NETCOREAPP2_0
public static void Show(string message)
{
Console.WriteLine(message);
}
#elif WINDOWS_UWP
public static async Task ShowAsync(string message)
{
await new MessageDialog(message).ShowAsync();
}
#endif
public static int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
}
Using Visual Studio, a shared project can be added from the Reference
Manager with the Shared Project selection as shown in Figure 19-8.
Source code is included, and the Import element is used with the
project file (project file
UsingASharedProject/UsingASharedProject/UsingASharedProject.csproj


FIGURE 19-8
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
<TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
<Import Project="..\SharedProject\SharedProject.projitems"
Label="Shared" />
</Project>
The Message class can now be used similarly to the way it would be
used as a class of the same project (code file
UsingASharedProject/UsingASharedProject/Program.cs ):
using SharedProject;
namespace UsingASharedProject
{
class Program
{
static void Main()
{
Message.Show(".NET Core");


}
}
}
From the UWP application, the Message class can be used in the same
way. Here, the ShowAsync method is invoked in the Click handler of a
Button (code file
UsingASharedProject/UniversalApp/MainPage.xaml.cs ):
private async void OnButtonClick(object sender,
RoutedEventArgs e)
{
await Message.ShowAsync("Hello from UWP");
}
NOTE
When you work with the Visual Studio editor on the source code
of the shared project, you can select the drop-down view on top of
the editor to select the current project you would like to work
with. This grays out the code that is currently not available based
on the defined preprocessor definitions.
CREATING NUGET PACKAGES
We’ve taken an excursion to shared projects, but now let’s continue
with libraries—and creating NuGet packages from libraries. NuGet
packages can be created easily by using the .NET Core CLI tools and
with Visual Studio 2017.
NuGet Packages with the Command Line
Metadata information about the NuGet package can be added to the
project file csproj as shown earlier in the “Assemblies” section. To
create a NuGet package from the command line, you can use the
dotnet pack command:
> dotnet pack --configuration Release


Remember to set the configuration. By default, the Debug
configuration is built. After a successful packaging, you can find the
NuGet package in the directory bin/Release or related directories,
depending on the selected configuration with the file extension .nupkg .
A .nupkg file is a zip file that contains the binary with additional
metadata. You can rename this file to a zip file to see its contents.
You can copy the generated NuGet package to a folder on your system
or to a network share to make it available to your team. The sample is
copied to the folder c:/MyPackages . To use this folder, the NuGet.config
file can be changed to include this package source as shown in the
section NuGet Sources. You also can reference the folder directly using
the dotnet add package command:
> dotnet add package SampleLib --source c:/MyPackages
Supporting Multiple Platforms
The .NET Standard 2.0 has been enhanced to support a lot more APIs
that are available on every new .NET platform. However, this is still
not enough for some applications. You might either need legacy
libraries that use more APIs than are available from the .NET
Standard, or you might need features that are different between APIs
such as WPF, UWP, and Xamarin. .NET Core also offers more features
than are available from the .NET Standard.
Previously you’ve seen how Shared Projects can be used to support
different platforms. Another option is to create different binaries from
the same source code as shown in the next example.
The sample library SampleLib supports both .NET Standard 2.0 as well
as .NET Framework 4.7 with different binaries. To build multiple
binaries, the TargetFramework element can be changed to
TargetFrameworks , and all the target framework monikers for the
target frameworks where binaries should be created are listed within.
The example adds the target framework monikers netstandard2.0 and
net47 . For code differences based on the target frameworks, different
conditional compilation symbols are defined (project file
CreateNuGet/SampleLib/SampleLib.csproj ):


<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFrameworks>netstandard2.0;net47</TargetFrameworks>
<!-- Metadata information -->
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup
Condition="'$(TargetFramework)'=='netstandard2.0'">
<DefineConstants>NETSTANDARD2_0</DefineConstants>
</PropertyGroup>
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)'=='net47'">
<DefineConstants>DOTNET47</DefineConstants>
</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
NOTE
The list of target framework monikers is shown at
https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/schema/target-frameworks .
With the code, so you can easily see different functionality, different
strings are initialized with different values, and this value is returned
from the Show method (code file CreateNuGet/SampleLib/Demo.cs ):
public class Demo
{
#if NETSTANDARD2_0
private static string s_info = ".NET Standard 2.0";
#elif DOTNET47
private static string s_info = ".NET 4.7";
#else
private static string s_info = "Unknown";
#endif
public static string Show() => s_info;
}
With this setup, you build the application with multiple target
frameworks, and a DLL for every target framework is created. When
you create a NuGet, one package is created that contains all the
libraries.


When you create a .NET Core Console application, you can build the
application for multiple target frameworks as well. Like the library
before, with the console application multiple target frameworks are
configured. The console application will be built for .NET Core 2.0 and
the .NET Framework 4.7 (project file
CreateNuGet/DotnetCaller/DotnetCaller.csproj ):
<TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp2.0;net47</TargetFrameworks>
It’s also possible to add packages only for specific target frameworks.
You can do this with the dotnet add package command by adding the -
-framework option:
> dotnet add package SampleLib --framework net47 --source
c:/MyPackages
This shows up with a condition based on the target framework in the
project file as shown:
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net47'">
<PackageReference Include="SampleLib" Version="1.2.0" />
</ItemGroup>
With the sample application, the same package is needed, but different
assemblies from the package need to be selected. This is done
automatically based on the project, and the package just needs to be
added to the project. The complete project file for the console
application is shown here (project file
CreateNuGet/DotnetCaller/DotnetCaller.csproj ):
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
<TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp2.0;net47</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup>
<PackageReference Include="SampleLib" Version="1.2.0" />
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
Building the console application creates multiple binaries that contain
references to different libraries.


> dotnet run --framework net47
results in the output
.NET 4.7
Using the .NET Core variant
> dotnet run --framework netcoreapp2.0
results in this output
.NET Standard 2.0
Be aware that selecting a different .NET Framework version, such as
.NET 4.6.1, also results in .NET Standard 2.0. This is because the
library built with .NET Framework 4.7 is not compatible with .NET
4.6.1 (only newer versions of .NET Framework are), but .NET 4.6.1 is
compatible with .NET Standard 2.0, so this library matches.
NuGet Packages with Visual Studio
Visual Studio 2017 allows you to create packages. In the Solution
Explorer, when you select the project, you can open the context menu
and select Pack to create a NuGet package. In the Project properties of
the Package settings, you can also select to create a NuGet package on
every build. This is probably overkill if you don’t plan to distribute
packages on every build. However, with this setting you should
configure the package metadata as well as the assembly and package
version (see Figure 19-9).


FIGURE 19-9
You can use packages within Visual Studio by selecting Dependencies
in the Solution Explorer, opening the context menu, and selecting
Manage NuGet Packages. This opens the NuGet Package Manager (see
Figure 19-10) where you can select the package sources (including the
packages from the local folder if you configured this via clicking on the
Settings icon). You can browse the available packages, see the
packages installed with the project, and check whether updates of
packages are available.


FIGURE 19-10
NOTE
In case you want to create NuGet packages not only for internal
use but also for publishing on the NuGet server, only adding the
library to the NuGet file is not enough. You can add a readme file,
add libraries from related projects, define dependencies, and
create build scripts. For this, you need the NuGet utility from
www.nuget.org . Visit https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget to get
more information about how to do this.
SUMMARY
This chapter explained the differences between DLLs, assemblies, and


NuGet packages. You’ve seen how to create and distribute libraries
with NuGet packages.
The .NET Standard defines an API set that is implemented from
different .NET platforms. You’ve seen how a .NET Standard library
can be used from .NET Core and the .NET Framework, and how types
come from different libraries, such as mscorlib and System.Runtime .
The next chapter gets into the details of an important pattern:
dependency injection. In this chapter you learn about another way of
sharing code with different platforms by injecting platform-specific
features.
