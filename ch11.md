## OVERVIEW
Chapter 10, “Collections,” covers lists, queues, stacks, dictionaries, and
linked lists. This chapter continues with special collections, such as
collections for dealing with bits, collections that can be observed when
changed, collections that cannot be changed, and collections that can
be accessed from multiple threads simultaneously.

## WORKING WITH BITS
If you need to deal with a number of bits, C# 7 has extensions like the
binary literal and the number separator that are covered in Chapter 2,
“Core C#,” and Chapter 6, “Operators and Casts.” When you work with
binary data, you can also use the class BitArray and the struct
BitVector32 . BitArray is located in the namespace System.Collections ,
and BitVector32 is in the namespace System.Collections.Specialized .
The most important difference between these two types is that
BitArray is resizable——which is useful if you don’t have advance
knowledge of the number of bits needed——and it can contain a large
number of bits. BitVector32 is stack-based and therefore faster.
BitVector32 contains only 32 bits, which are stored in an integer.

### BitArray
The class BitArray is a reference type that contains an array of int s,
where for every 32 bits a new integer is used. Members of this class are
described in the following table.
BITARRAY DESCRIPTION
MEMBERS
Count
The get accessor of both Count and Length return the
Length
number of bits in the array. With the Length property,
you can also define a new size and resize the collection.
Item
You can use an indexer to read and write bits in the
Get
array. The indexer is of type bool . Instead of using the
Set
indexer, you can also use the Get and Set methods to
access the bits in the array.


SetAll
Not
And
Or
Xor
The method SetAll sets the values of all bits according
to the parameter passed to the method.
The method Not generates the inverse of all bits of the
array.
With the methods And , Or , and Xor , you can combine
two BitArray objects. The And method does a binary
AND, where the result bits are set only if the bits from
both input arrays are set. The Or method does a binary
OR, where the result bits are set if one or both input
arrays are set. The Xor method is an exclusive OR,
where the result is set if only one of the input bits is set.

**NOTE**
In Chapter 6 covers bitwise operators that can be used with
number types such as byte , short , int , and long . The BitArray
class has similar functionality but can be used with a different
number of bits than the C# types.
The BitArraySample makes use of the following namespaces:
System
System.Collections
System.Text
The extension method GetBitsFormat iterates through a BitArray and
writes 1 or 0 to the console, depending on whether the bit is set. For
better readability, a separator character is added every four bits (code
file BitArraySample/BitArrayExtensions.cs ):
public static class BitArrayExtensions
{
public static string GetBitsFormat(this BitArray bits)
{
var sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = bits.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)


{
sb.Append(bits[i] ? 1 : 0);
if (i != 0 && i % 4 == 0)
{
sb.Append("_");
}
}
return sb.ToString();
}
}
The example to demonstrate the BitArray class creates a bit array with
nine bits, indexed from 0 to 8. The SetAll method sets all nine bits to
true . Then the Set method changes bit 1 to false . Instead of the Set
method, you can also use an indexer, as shown with index 5 and 7 :
(code file BitArraySample/Program.cs ):
var bits1 = new BitArray(9);
bits1.SetAll(true);
bits1.Set(1, false);
bits1[5] = false;
bits1[7] = false;
Console.Write("initialized: ");
Console.WriteLine(bits1.GetBitsFormat());
This is the displayed result of the initialized bits:
initialized: 1_0101_1101
The Not method generates the inverse of the bits of the BitArray :
Console.Write("not ");
Console.Write(bits1.GetBitsFormat());
bits1.Not();
Console.Write(" = ");
Console.WriteLine(bits1.GetBitsFormat());
The result of Not is all bits inversed. If the bit were true , it is false ; and
if it were false , it is true :
not 1_0101_1101 = 0_1010_0010
In the following example, a new BitArray is created. With the
constructor, the variable bits1 is used to initialize the array, so the
new array has the same values. Then the values for bits 0, 1, and 4 are


set to different values. Before the Or method is used, the bit arrays
bits1 and bits2 are displayed. The Or method changes the values of
bits1 :
var bits2 = new BitArray(bits1);
bits2[0] = true;
bits2[1] = false;
bits2[4] = true;
Console.Write($"{bits1.GetBitsFormat()} OR
{bits2.GetBitsFormat()}");
Console.Write(" = ");
bits1.Or(bits2);
Console.WriteLine(bits1.GetBitsFormat());
With the Or method, the set bits are taken from both input arrays. In
the result, the bit is set if it was set with either the first or the second
array:
0_1010_0010 OR 0_1011_0001 = 0_1011_0011
Next, the And method is used to operate on bits2 and bits1 :
Console.Write($"{bits2.GetBitsFormat()} AND
{bits1.GetBitsFormat()}");
Console.Write(" = ");
bits2.And(bits1);
Console.WriteLine(bits2.GetBitsFormat());
The result of the And method only sets the bits where the bit was set in
both input arrays:
0_1011_0001 AND 0_1011_0011 = 0_1011_0001
Finally, the Xor method is used for an exclusive OR :
Console.Write($"{bits1.GetBitsFormat()} XOR
{bits2.GetBitsFormat()}");
bits1.Xor(bits2);
Console.Write(" = ");
Console.WriteLine(bits1.GetBitsFormat());
With the Xor method, the resultant bits are set only if the bit was set
either in the first or the second input, but not both:
0_1011_0011 XOR 0_1011_0001 = 0_0000_0010


BitVector32
If you know in advance how many bits you need, you can use the
BitVector32 structure instead of BitArray . BitVector32 is more
efficient because it is a value type and stores the bits on the stack
inside an integer. With a single integer you have a place for 32 bits. If
you need more bits, you can use multiple BitVector32 values or the
BitArray . The BitArray can grow as needed; this is not an option with
BitVector32 .
The following table shows the members of BitVector that are very
different from BitArray :
BITVECTOR DESCRIPTION
MEMBERS
Data
The property Data returns the data behind the
BitVector32 as an integer.
Item
The values for the BitVector32 can be set using an
indexer. The indexer is overloaded; you can get and
set the values using a mask or a section of type
BitVector32.Section.
CreateMask
is a static method that you can use to
create a mask for accessing specific bits in the
CreateMask
BitVector32.
is a static method that you can use to
create several sections within the 32 bits.
CreateSection CreateSection
The BitVectorSample makes use of the following namespaces:
System
System.Collections.Specialized
System.Linq
The following example creates a BitVector32 with the default
constructor, whereby all 32 bits are initialized to false . Then masks
are created to access the bits inside the bit vector. The first call to
CreateMask creates a mask to access the first bit. After CreateMask is


invoked, bit1 has a value of 1. Invoking CreateMask once more and
passing the first mask as a parameter to CreateMask returns a mask to
access the second bit, which is 2. bit3 then has a value of 4 to access
bit number 3, and bit4 has a value of 8 to access bit number 4.
Then the masks are used with the indexer to access the bits inside the
bit vector and to set the fields accordingly (code file
BitVectorSample/Program.cs ):
var bits1 = new BitVector32();
int bit1 = BitVector32.CreateMask();
int bit2 = BitVector32.CreateMask(bit1);
int bit3 = BitVector32.CreateMask(bit2);
int bit4 = BitVector32.CreateMask(bit3);
int bit5 = BitVector32.CreateMask(bit4);
bits1[bit1] = true;
bits1[bit2] = false;
bits1[bit3] = true;
bits1[bit4] = true;
bits1[bit5] = true;
Console.WriteLine(bits1);
The BitVector32 has an overridden ToString method that not only
displays the name of the class but also 1 or 0 if the bits are set or not,
respectively:
BitVector32{00000000000000000000000000011101}
Instead of creating a mask with the CreateMask method, you can define
the mask yourself; you can also set multiple bits at once. The
hexadecimal value abcdef is the same as the binary value 1010 1011
1100 1101 1110 1111 . All the bits defined with this value are set:
bits1[0xabcdef] = true;
Console.WriteLine(bits1);
With the output shown you can verify the bits that are set:
BitVector32{00000000101010111100110111101111}
Separating the 32 bits to different sections can be extremely useful.
For example, an IPv4 address is defined as a four-byte number that is
stored inside an integer. You can split the integer by defining four
sections. With a multicast IP message, several 32-bit values are used.


One of these 32-bit values is separated in these sections: 16 bits for the
number of sources, 8 bits for a querier’s query interval code, 3 bits for
a querier’s robustness variable, a 1-bit suppress flag, and 4 bits that are
reserved. You can also define your own bit meanings to save memory.
The following example simulates receiving the value 0x79abcdef and
passes this value to the constructor of BitVector32 , so that the bits are
set accordingly:
int received = 0x79abcdef;
BitVector32 bits2 = new BitVector32(received);
Console.WriteLine(bits2);
The bits are shown on the console as initialized:
BitVector32{01111001101010111100110111101111}
Then six sections are created. The first section requires 12 bits, as
defined by the hexadecimal value 0xfff (12 bits are set); section B
requires 8 bits; section C, 4 bits; sections D and E, 3 bits; and section
F, 2 bits. The first call to CreateSection just receives 0xfff to allocate
the first 12 bits. With the second call to CreateSection , the first section
is passed as an argument, so the next section continues where the first
section ended. CreateSection returns a value of type
BitVector32.Section that contains the offset and the mask for the
section:
// sections: FF EEE DDD CCCC BBBBBBBB
// AAAAAAAAAAAA
BitVector32.Section sectionA =
BitVector32.CreateSection(0xfff);
BitVector32.Section sectionB =
BitVector32.CreateSection(0xff, sectionA);
BitVector32.Section sectionC = BitVector32.CreateSection(0xf,
sectionB);
BitVector32.Section sectionD = BitVector32.CreateSection(0x7,
sectionC);
BitVector32.Section sectionE = BitVector32.CreateSection(0x7,
sectionD);
BitVector32.Section sectionF = BitVector32.CreateSection(0x3,
sectionE);
Passing a BitVector32.Section to the indexer of the BitVector32


returns an int just mapped to the section of the bit vector. As shown
next, the extension method, ToBinaryString , returns a string
representation of the int number:
Console.WriteLine($"Section A:
{bits2[sectionA].ToBinaryString()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Section B:
{bits2[sectionB].ToBinaryString()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Section C:
{bits2[sectionC].ToBinaryString()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Section D:
{bits2[sectionD].ToBinaryString()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Section E:
{bits2[sectionE].ToBinaryString()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Section F:
{bits2[sectionF].ToBinaryString()}");
The method ToBinaryString receives the bits in an integer and returns
a string representation containing 0 and 1. With the implementation,
the Convert.ToString method is used to create a binary representation
using the toBase parameter value 2. With the AddSeparators extension
method, after every four bits a separator character is inserted with the
help of the string.Join method to combine an array to a string, and
LINQ methods. LINQ is covered in the next chapter in detail (code file
BitVectorSample/BinaryExtensions.cs ):
public static class BinaryExtensions
{
public static string AddSeparators(this string number) =>
number.Length <= 4 ? number :
string.Join("_",
Enumerable.Range(0, number.Length / 4)
.Select(i => number.Substring(i * 4,
4)).ToArray());
public static string ToBinaryString(this int number) =>
Convert.ToString(number, toBase: 2).AddSeparators();
}
The result displays the bit representation of sections A to F, which you
can now verify with the value that was passed into the bit vector:
Section A: 1101_1110_1111
Section B: 1011_1100

## OBSERVABLE COLLECTIONS
In case you need information when items in the collection are removed
or added, you can use the ObservableCollection<T> class. This class
originally was defined for WPF so that the UI is informed about
collection changes. It’s now used with Universal Windows Apps the
same way. The namespace of this class is
System.Collections.ObjectModel .
derives from the base class Collection<T>
that can be used to create custom collections and it uses List<T>
internally. From the base class, the virtual methods SetItem and
RemoveItem are overridden to fire the CollectionChanged event. Clients
of this class can register to this event by using the interface
INotifyCollectionChanged .
ObservableCollection<T>
The ObservableCollectionSample makes use of the following
namespaces:
System
System.Collections.ObjectModel
System.Collections.Specialized
This example demonstrates using an ObservableCollection<string>
where the method Data_CollectionChanged is registered to the
CollectionChanged event. Two items are added to the end——one item is
inserted, and one item is removed (code file
ObservableCollectionSample/Program.cs ):
var data = new ObservableCollection<string>();
data.CollectionChanged += Data_CollectionChanged;
data.Add("One");
data.Add("Two");
data.Insert(1, "Three");
data.Remove("One");


The method Data_CollectionChanged receives
NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs containing information about
changes to the collection. The Action property provides information if
an item was added or removed. With removed items, the OldItems
property is set and lists the removed items. With added items, the
NewItems property is set and lists the new items:
public static void Data_CollectionChanged(object sender,
NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs e)
{
Console.WriteLine($"action: {e.Action.ToString()}");
if (e.OldItems != null)
{
Console.WriteLine($"starting index for old item(s):
{e.OldStartingIndex}");
Console.WriteLine("old item(s):");
foreach (var item in e.OldItems)
{
Console.WriteLine(item);
}
}
if (e.NewItems != null)
{
Console.WriteLine($"starting index for new item(s):
{e.NewStartingIndex}");
Console.WriteLine("new item(s): ");
foreach (var item in e.NewItems)
{
Console.WriteLine(item);
}
}
Console.WriteLine();
}
Running the application results in the following output. First the items
One and Two are added to the collection, and thus the Add action is
shown with the index 0 and 1 . The third item, Three , is inserted on
position 1 so it shows the action Add with index 1 . Finally, the item One
is removed as shown with the action Remove and index 0 :
action: Add
starting index for new item(s): 0
new item(s):
One
action: Add


starting index for new item(s): 1
new item(s):
Two
action: Add
starting index for new item(s): 1
new item(s):
Three
action: Remove
starting index for old item(s): 0
old item(s):
One
IMMUTABLE COLLECTIONS
If an object can change its state, it is hard to use it from multiple
simultaneously running tasks. Synchronization is necessary with these
collections. If an object cannot change state, it’s a lot easier to use it
from multiple threads. An object that can’t change is an immutable
object. Collections that cannot be changed are immutable collections.
**NOTE**
The topics of using multiple tasks and threads and programming
with asynchronous methods are explained in detail in Chapter 15,
“Asynchronous Programming,” and Chapter 21, “Tasks and
Parallel Programming.”
Comparing read-only collections that have been discussed in the
previous chapter with immutable collections, there’s a big difference:
read-only collections make use of an interface to mutable collections.
Using this interface, the collection cannot be changed. However, if
someone still has a reference to the mutable collection, it still can be
changed. With immutable collections, nobody can change this
collection.
The ImmutableCollectionSample makes use of the following
namespaces:
System


System.Collections.Generic
System.Collections.Immutable
Let’s start with a simple immutable string array. You can create the
array with the static Create method as shown. The Create method is
overloaded where other variants of this method allow passing any
number of elements. Pay attention that two different types are used
here: the non-generic ImmutableArray class with the static Create
method and the generic ImmutableArray struct that is returned from
the Create method. In the following code snippet an empty array is
created (code file ImmutableCollectionSample/Program.cs ):
ImmutableArray<string> a1 = ImmutableArray.Create<string>();
An empty array is not very useful. The ImmutableArray<T> type offers
an Add method to add elements. However, contrary to other collection
classes, the Add method does not change the immutable collection
itself. Instead, a new immutable collection is returned. So, after the
call of the Add method, a1 is still an empty collection, and a2 is an
immutable collection with one element. The Add method returns the
new immutable collection:
ImmutableArray<string> a2 = a1.Add("Williams");
With this, it is possible to use this API in a fluent way and invoke one
Add method after the other. The variable a3 now references an
immutable collection containing four elements:
ImmutableArray<string> a3 =
a2.Add("Ferrari").Add("Mercedes").Add("Red Bull Racing");
With each of these stages using the immutable array, the complete
collections are not copied with every step. Instead, the immutable
types make use of shared state and only copy the collection when it’s
necessary.
However, it’s even more efficient to first fill the collection and then
make it an immutable array. When some manipulation needs to take
place, you can again use a mutable collection. A builder class offered
by the immutable types helps with that.


To see this in action, first an Account class is created that is put into
the collection. This type itself is immutable and cannot be changed by
using read-only auto properties (code file
ImmutableCollectionSample/Account.cs):
public class Account
{
public Account(string name, decimal amount)
{
Name = name;
Amount = amount;
}
public string Name { get; }
public decimal Amount { get; }
}
Next a List<Account> collection is created and filled with sample
accounts (code file ImmutableCollectionSample/Program.cs ):
var accounts = new List<Account>()
{
new Account("Scrooge McDuck", 667377678765m),
new Account("Donald Duck", -200m),
new Account("Ludwig von Drake", 20000m)
};
From the accounts collection, an immutable collection can be created
with the extension method ToImmutableList . This extension method is
available as soon as the namespace System.Collections.Immutable is
opened.
ImmutableList<Account> immutableAccounts =
accounts.ToImmutableList();
The variable immutableAccounts can be enumerated like other
collections. It just cannot be changed:
foreach (var account in immutableAccounts)
{
Console.WriteLine($"{account.Name} {account.Amount}");
}
Instead of using the foreach statement to iterate immutable lists, you


can use the ForEach method that is defined with ImmutableList<T> .
This method requires an Action<T> delegate as parameter and thus a
lambda expression can be assigned:
immutableAccounts.ForEach(a => Console.WriteLine($"{a.Name}
{a.Amount}"));
Working with these collections, methods like Contains , FindAll ,
FindLast , IndexOf , and others are available. Because these methods are
like the methods from other collection classes discussed in Chapter 10,
they are not explicitly shown here.
In case you need to change the content for immutable collections, the
collections offer methods like Add , AddRange , Remove , RemoveAt ,
RemoveRange , Replace , and Sort . These methods are very different from
normal collection classes as the immutable collection that is used to
invoke the methods is never changed, but these methods return a new
immutable collection.
Using Builders with Immutable Collections
Creating new immutable collections from existing ones can be done
easily with the mentioned Add , Remove , and Replace methods. However,
this is not very efficient if you need to do multiple changes such as
adding and removing elements for the new collection. For creating
new immutable collections by doing more changes, you can create a
builder.
Let’s continue with the sample code and make multiple changes to the
account objects in the collection. For doing this, you can create a
builder by invoking the ToBuilder method. This method returns a
collection that you can change. In the sample code, all accounts with
an amount larger than 0 are removed. The original immutable
collection is not changed. After the change with the builder is
completed, a new immutable collection is created by invoking the
ToImmutable method of the Builder . This collection is used next to
output all overdrawn accounts:
ImmutableList<Account>.Builder builder =
immutableAccounts.ToBuilder();


for (int i = 0; i > builder.Count; i++)
{
Account a = builder[i];
if (a.Amount < 0)
{
builder.Remove(a);
}
}
ImmutableList<Account> overdrawnAccounts =
builder.ToImmutable();
overdrawnAccounts.ForEach(a =< WriteLine($"{a.Name}
{a.Amount}"));
Other than removing elements with the Remove method, the Builder
type offers the methods Add , AddRange , Insert , RemoveAt , RemoveAll ,
Reverse , and Sort to change the mutable collection. After finishing the
mutable operations, invoke ToImmutable to get the immutable
collection again.
Immutable Collection Types and Interfaces
Other than ImmutableArray and ImmutableList , the NuGet package
System.Collections.Immutable offers some more immutable collection
types as shown in the following table:


## IMMUTABLE TYPE DESCRIPTION
ImmutableArray<T> ImmutableArray<T>
ImmutableList<T>
ImmutableQueue<T>
is a struct that
uses an array type internally but
doesn’t allow changes to the
underlying type. This struct
implements the interface
IImmutableList<T> .
ImmutableList<T> uses a binary
tree internally to map the objects
and implements the interface
IImmutableList<T> .
ImmutableQueue<T> implements the
interface IImmutableQueue<T> that
allows access to elements first-in-
first-out with Enqueue , Dequeue , and


Peek .
ImmutableStack<T>
ImmutableStack<T> implements the
interface IImmutableStack<T> that
allows access to elements first-in-
last-out with Push , Pop , and Peek .
ImmutableDictionary<TKey,
TValue>
ImmutableDictionary<TKey,
TValue> is an immutable collection
with unordered key/value pair
elements implementing the
interface
IImmutableDictionary<TKey,
TValue> .
ImmutableSortedDictionary<TKey, ImmutableSortedDictionary<TKey,
TValue>
TValue> is an immutable collection
with ordered key/value pair
elements implementing the
interface
IImmutableDictionary<TKey,
TValue> .
ImmutableHashSet<T>
ImmutableSortedSet<T>
is an
immutable unordered hash set
implementing the interface
IImmutableSet<T> . This interface
offers set functionality explained in
Chapter 10.
ImmutableSortedSet<T> is an
immutable ordered set
implementing the interface
IImmutableSet<T> .
ImmutableHashSet<T>
Like the normal collection classes, immutable collections implement
interfaces as well——such as IImmutableList<T> , IImmutableQueue<T> ,
and IImmutableStack<T> . The big difference with these immutable
interfaces is that all the methods that make a change in the collection
return a new collection.
Using LINQ with Immutable Arrays


For using LINQ with immutable arrays, the class
ImmutableArrayExtensions defines optimized versions for LINQ
methods such as Where , Aggregate , All , First , Last , Select , and
SelectMany . All that you need to use the optimized versions is to
directly use the ImmutableArray type and open the System.Linq
namespace.
The Where method defined with the ImmutableArrayExtensions type
looks like this to extend the ImmutableArray<T> type:
public static IEnumerable<T> Where<T>(
this ImmutableArray<T> immutableArray, Func<T, bool>
predicate);
The normal LINQ extension method extends IEnumerable<T> . Because
ImmutableArray<T> is a better match, the optimized version is used
calling LINQ methods.
**NOTE**
LINQ is explained in detail in Chapter 12, “Language Integrated
Query.”


## CONCURRENT COLLECTIONS
Immutable collections can easily be used from multiple threads
because they cannot be changed. In case you want to use collections
that should be changed from multiple threads, .NET offers thread-safe
collection classes within the namespace
System.Collections.Concurrent . Thread-safe collections are guarded
against multiple threads accessing them in conflicting ways.
For thread-safe access of collections, the interface
IProducerConsumerCollection<T> is defined. The most important
methods of this interface are TryAdd and TryTake . TryAdd tries to add
an item to the collection, but this might fail if the collection is locked
from adding items. To provide this information, the method returns a


Boolean value indicating success or failure. TryTake works the same
way to inform the caller about success or failure, and returns on
success an item from the collection. The following list describes the
collection classes from the System.Collections.Concurrent namespace
and its functionality:
ConcurrentQueue<T> ——This
class is implemented with a lock-free
algorithm and uses 32 item arrays that are combined in a linked
list internally. Methods to access the elements of the queue are
Enqueue , TryDequeue , and TryPeek . The naming of these methods is
very similar to the methods of Queue<T> that you know already,
with the difference of the Try prefix to indicate that the method
call might fail.
Because this class implements the interface
IProducerConsumerCollection<T> , the methods TryAdd and TryTake
just invoke Enqueue and TryDequeue .
ConcurrentStack<T> ——Very
similar to ConcurrentQueue<T> but with
other item access methods, this class defines the methods Push ,
PushRange , TryPeek , TryPop , and TryPopRange . Internally this class
uses a linked list of its items.
ConcurrentBag<T> ——This
class doesn’t define any order in which to
add or take items. It uses a concept that maps threads to arrays
used internally and thus tries to reduce locks. The methods to
access elements are Add , TryPeek , and TryTake .
ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue >——This is a thread-safe
collection of keys and values. TryAdd , TryGetValue , TryRemove , and
TryUpdate are methods to access the members in a nonblocking
fashion. Because the items are based on keys and values,
ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue > does not implement
IProducerConsumerCollection<T> .
BlockingCollection<T> ——A collection
that blocks and waits until it
is possible to do the task by adding or taking the item,
BlockingCollection<T> offers an interface to add and remove items
with the Add and Take methods. These methods block the thread
and wait until the task becomes possible. The Add method has an


overload whereby you also can pass a CancellationToken . This
token enables canceling a blocking call. If you don’t want the
thread to wait for an endless time, and you don’t want to cancel the
call from the outside, the methods TryAdd and TryTake are offered
as well, whereby you can also specify a timeout value for the
maximum amount of time you would like to block the thread and
wait before the call should fail.
The ConcurrentXXX collection classes are thread-safe, returning false if
an action is not possible with the current state of threads. You always
have to check whether adding or taking the item was successful before
moving on. You can’t trust the collection to always fulfill the task.
BlockingCollection<T> is a decorator to any class implementing the
IProducerConsumerCollection<T> interface and by default uses
ConcurrentQueue<T> . With the constructor you can also pass any other
class that implements IProducerConsumerCollection<T> ——such as
ConcurrentBag<T> and ConcurrentStack<T> .
Creating Pipelines
A great use for these concurrent collection classes is with pipelines.
One task writes some content to a collection class while another task
can read from the collection at the same time.
The following sample application demonstrates the use of the
BlockingCollection<T> class with multiple tasks that form a pipeline.
The first pipeline is shown in Figure 11-1. The task for the first stage
reads filenames and adds them to a queue. While this task is running,
the task for stage 2 can already start to read the filenames from the
queue and load their content. The result is written to another queue.
Stage 3 can be started at the same time to read the content from the
second queue and process it. Here, the result is written to a dictionary.


FIGURE 11-1
In this scenario, the next stage can only start when stage 3 is
completed and the content is finally processed with a full result in the
dictionary. The next steps are shown in Figure 11-2. Stage 4 reads from
the dictionary, converts the data, and writes it to a queue. Stage 5 adds
color information to the items and puts them in another queue. The
last stage displays the information. Stages 4 to 6 can run concurrently
as well.


FIGURE 11-2
The Info class represents items that are maintained by the pipeline
(code file PipelineSample/Info.cs ):
public class Info
{
public Info(string word, int count)
{
Word = word;
Count = count;
}
public string Word { get; }
public int Count { get; }
public string Color { get; set; }
public override string ToString() => $"{Count} times:
{Word}";
}
The PipelineSample makes use of the following namespaces:
System


System.Collections.Generic
System.Collections.Concurrent
System.IO
System.Linq
System.Threading.Tasks
Looking at the code of this sample application, the complete pipeline is
managed within the method StartPipeline . Here, the collections are
instantiated and passed to the various stages of the pipeline. The first
stage is processed with ReadFilenamesAsync , and the second and third
stages, LoadContentAsync and ProcessContentAsync , are running
simultaneously. The fourth stage, however, can only start when the
first three stages are completed (code file PipelineSample/Program.cs ):
public static async Task StartPipelineAsync()
{
var fileNames = new BlockingCollection<string>();
var lines = new BlockingCollection<string>();
var words = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, int>();
var items = new BlockingCollection<Info>();
var coloredItems = new BlockingCollection<Info>();
Task t1 = PipelineStages.ReadFilenamesAsync(@"../../..",
fileNames);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine("started stage 1");
Task t2 = PipelineStages.LoadContentAsync(fileNames,
lines);
ConsoleHelper.WriteLine("started stage 2");
Task t3 = PipelineStages.ProcessContentAsync(lines, words);
await Task.WhenAll(t1, t2, t3);
ConsoleHelper.WriteLine("stages 1, 2, 3 completed");
Task t4 = PipelineStages.TransferContentAsync(words,
items);
Task t5 = PipelineStages.AddColorAsync(items,
coloredItems);
Task t6 = PipelineStages.ShowContentAsync(coloredItems);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine("stages 4, 5, 6 started");
await Task.WhenAll(t4, t5, t6);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine("all stages finished");
}


**NOTE**
This example application makes use of tasks and the async and
await keywords, which are explained in detail in Chapter 15. You
can read more about threads, tasks, and synchronization in
Chapter 21. File I/O is discussed in Chapter 22, “Files and
Streams.”
The example writes information to the console using the
ColoredConsole class. This class provides an easy way to change the
color for console output and uses synchronization to avoid returning
output with the wrong colors (code file
PipelineSample/ColoredConsole.cs ):
public static class ColoredConsole
{
private static object syncOutput = new object();
public static void WriteLine(string message)
{
lock (syncOutput)
{
Console.WriteLine(message);
}
}
public static void WriteLine(string message, string color)
{
lock (syncOutput)
{
Console.ForegroundColor = (ConsoleColor)Enum.Parse(
typeof(ConsoleColor), color);
Console.WriteLine(message);
Console.ResetColor();
}
}
}
Using a BlockingCollection
Let’s get into the first stage of the pipeline. ReadFilenamesAsync
receives a BlockingCollection<T> where it can write its output. The


implementation of this method uses an enumerator to iterate C# files
within the specified directory and its subdirectories. The filenames are
added to the BlockingCollection<T> with the Add method. After adding
filenames is completed, the CompleteAdding method is invoked to
inform all readers that they should not wait for any additional items in
the collection (code file PipelineSample/PipelineStages.cs ):
public static class PipelineStages
{
public static Task ReadFilenamesAsync(string path,
BlockingCollection<string> output)
{
return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
foreach (string filename in
Directory.EnumerateFiles(path, "*.cs",
SearchOption.AllDirectories))
{
output.Add(filename);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine($"stage 1: added
{filename}");
}
output.CompleteAdding();
}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
}
//. . .
**NOTE**
If you have a reader that reads from a BlockingCollection<T> at
the same time a writer adds items, it is important to invoke the
CompleteAdding method. Otherwise, the reader would wait for
more items to arrive within the foreach loop.
The next stage is to read the file and add its content to another
collection, which is done from the LoadContentAsync method. This
method uses the filenames passed with the input collection, opens the
file, and adds all lines of the file to the output collection. With the
foreach loop, the method GetConsumingEnumerable is invoked with the
input blocking collection to iterate the items. It’s possible to use the


variable directly without invoking GetConsumingEnumerable , but
this would only iterate the current state of the collection, and not the
items that are added afterward.
input
public static async Task
LoadContentAsync(BlockingCollection<string> input,
BlockingCollection<string> output)
{
foreach (var filename in input.GetConsumingEnumerable())
{
using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead(filename))
{
var reader = new StreamReader(stream);
string line = null;
while ((line = await reader.ReadLineAsync()) != null)
{
output.Add(line);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine($"stage 2: added {line}");
}
}
}
output.CompleteAdding();
}
**NOTE**
If a reader is reading a collection at the same time while it is
filled, you need to get the enumerator of the blocking collection
with the method GetConsumingEnumerable instead of iterating the
collection directly.
Using a ConcurrentDictionary
Stage 3 is implemented in the ProcessContentAsync method. This
method gets the lines from the input collection, and then splits and
filters words to an output dictionary. The method AddOrUpdate is a
method from the ConcurrentDictionary type. If the key is not yet
added to the dictionary, the second parameter defines the value that
should be set. If the key is already available in the dictionary, the


parameter defines how the value should be
changed. In this case, the existing value is just incremented by one:
updateValueFactory
public static Task
ProcessContentAsync(BlockingCollection<string> input,
ConcurrentDictionary<string, int> output)
{
return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
foreach (var line in input.GetConsumingEnumerable())
{
string[] words = line.Split(' ', ';', '\t', '{', '}',
'(', ')', ':',
',', '"');
foreach (var word in words.Where(w =>
!string.IsNullOrEmpty(w)))
{
output.AddOrUpdate(key: word, addValue: 1,
updateValueFactory: (s, i) => ++i);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine($"stage 3: added {word}");
}
}
}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
}
Running the application with the first three stages, you’ll see output
like the following, where the stages operate interleaved:
stage
stage
stage
stage
stage
stage
stage
stage
stage

3:

DisplayBits
bits2
Write
=
bits1.Or
DisplayBits(bits2);
Write(" and ");
DisplayBits(bits1);
WriteLine();
DisplayBits(bits2);
Completing the Pipeline
After the first three stages are completed, the next three stages can run
in parallel again. TransferContentAsync gets the data from the
dictionary, converts it to the type Info , and puts it into the output
BlockingCollection<T> (code file PipelineSample/PipelineStages.cs ):


public static Task TransferContentAsync(
ConcurrentDictionary<string, int> input,
BlockingCollection<Info> output)
{
return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
foreach (var word in input.Keys)
{
if (input.TryGetValue(word, out int value))
{
var info = new Info { Word = word, Count = value };
output.Add(info);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine($"stage 4: added {info}");
}
}
output.CompleteAdding();
}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
}
The pipeline stage AddColorAsync sets the Color property of the Info
type depending on the value of the Count property:
public static Task AddColorAsync(BlockingCollection<Info>
input,
BlockingCollection<Info> output)
{
return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
foreach (var item in input.GetConsumingEnumerable())
{
if (item.Count > 40)
{
item.Color = "Red";
}
else if (item.Count > 20)
{
item.Color = "Yellow";
}
else
{
item.Color = "Green";
}
output.Add(item);
ColoredConsole.WriteLine($"stage 5: added color
{item.Color} to {item}");
}
output.CompleteAdding();


}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
}
The last stage writes the resulting items to the console in the specified
color:
public static Task ShowContentAsync(BlockingCollection<Info>
input)
{
return Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
foreach (var item in input.GetConsumingEnumerable())
{
ColoredConsole.WriteLine($"stage 6: {item}",
item.Color);
}
}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
}
Running the application results in the following output, and you’ll see
that it is colored:
stage 6: 20 times: static
stage 6: 3 times: Count
stage 6: 2 times: t2
stage 6: 1 times: bits2[sectionD]
stage 6: 3 times: set
stage 6: 2 times: Console.ReadLine
stage 6: 3 times: started
stage 6: 1 times: builder.Remove
stage 6: 1 times: reader
stage 6: 2 times: bit4
stage 6: 1 times: ForegroundColor
stage 6: 1 times: all
all stages finished

## SUMMARY
This chapter looked at working with special collections. The chapter
introduced you to BitArray and BitVector32 , which are optimized for
working with a collection of bits.
Not only bits are stored in the ObservableCollection<T> class. This
class raises events when items change in the list. Chapters 33 through
37 use this class with Windows and Xamarin apps.
This chapter also explained that immutable collections are a guarantee
that the collection never changes, and thus can be easily used in
multithreaded applications.
The last part of this chapter looked at concurrent collections where
one thread can be used to fill the collection while another thread
simultaneously retrieves items from the same collection.
Chapter 12 gives you details about Language Integrated Query (LINQ).
